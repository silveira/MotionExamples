# MotionExamples

Motion is a software application produced by Apple Inc. for their macOS operating system. It is used to create and edit motion graphics, titling for video production and film production, and 2D and 3D compositing for visual effects. 

This project is a repository of examples and reusable project files for Motion. Each project tries to demonstrate one animation technique.
